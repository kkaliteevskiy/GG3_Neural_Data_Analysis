    "- You should spend about 20 hours a week on the project, basically half of your time.\n",
    "- Project is to be carried out in **Google Colab** or on your own computer. You can download this notebook and use it with a normal Jupyter server, or duplicate it here in your **Colab** account. If you do the latter, you can share and show your work easily. The computational resources on **Colab** are limited, so you may find it more convenient to run the programs on your own computer, especially in the later parts of the project when computations will be heavier. When you need to ask a question about a specific piece of code, you can still use the **Colab** to share a notebook. \n",
    "- Weekly sessions will be held on Mondays 11:00-13:00, and Thursdays 9:00-11:00 and 14:00-16:00 all in **LR11** (EXCEPT for Monday 5th June which will be in LT6). \n",
    "- Attendance is compulsory for the first/introductory session and all Monday sessions. Thursday sessions will be optional (although this is still subject to change), but attending them is a good way to get answers to questions, some help with coding. It also provides space for teamwork with your teammates. \n",
    "- You are strongly encouraged to seek verbal feedback after your interim report - there will be a special session for this on Monday May 22 and Thursday May 25. \n",
    "- Project carries 80 marks overall:\n",
    "  - 20 marks for interim report (individual)\n",
    "  - 20 marks for presentation (group based)\n",
    "  - 40 marks for final report (individual)<br>\n",

    "### Project reports\n",
    "  - Should be clearly broken down by _Tasks_ (see below), any notes you wish to make in how you or your group structured and carried out the tasks, and most importantly your __results__ in the form of completely labelled graphs, and __accompanying conclusions__ you draw from your results. \n",
    "  - Interim report about 4-6 pages, and final report about 14-18 pages, when converted to a PDF (excluding appendices such as attached code, but _including_ figures). The final report can be an extension of the interim report, but make sure you take into account the feedback you receive for your interim report.  \n",
    "  - When deciding what to include in your report, how to organise it and what to emphasize, please prioritise communicating understanding over formalities - I would like give you marks for doing the right thing and showing that you did it and understand it. If I have to wade through pages of undigested data and graphs shown just because it was there, I will feel less generous. The length requirements are only guidelines. \n",
    "  - Take a look at [this page](http://teaching.eng.cam.ac.uk/node/444/#hdr-9) and [this](http://teaching.eng.cam.ac.uk/node/340) for further guidance and recommendations for writing reports.\n",
    "  - __All code__ that you used during to project must be attached as an appendix to your reports. If you modified one of the provided `.py` file (and you used that modified version for that report), include it. \n",
    "  - A jupyter or **Colab** notebook are acceptable as a report, as long as it is \"clean\" (its main section includes text and figures) and reads like a report, and (importantly) can be converted to a PDF, so you can upload it to the Moodle submission protal. \n",

    "### Presentations:\n",
    "- Each group will jointly prepare and present a 12 minute (strict!) presentation, broken up into three **4-minute parts** each delivered by one of the team members. There will be 3 minutes of question time after each talk, and so overall the session should take about an hour and a half. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Since most tasks are not really divided, the part presented by a student need not be something they solely contributed to. \n",
    "- The presentations will be held at the end of Week 3 or beginning of Week 4.\n",
